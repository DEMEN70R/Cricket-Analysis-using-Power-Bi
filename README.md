1. Openers: Analyzed top openers like Rilee Rossouw and Quinton de Kock, focusing on their strike rates and batting averages.
2. Anchors: Evaluated middle-order anchors such as Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav, examining their stability and run consistency.
3. All-rounders: Assessed the impact of all-rounders like Glenn Maxwell and Hardik Pandya, looking at their contributions with both bat and ball.
4. Finishers: Highlighted key finishers including Marcus Stoinis and Sikandar Raza, emphasizing their ability to close games effectively.
5. Bowlers: Reviewed the performances of specialist bowlers like Shaheen Shah Afridi and Sam Curran, focusing on their economy rates and wicket-taking abilities.

By leveraging the rich data from the tournament, this Power BI dashboard provides an insightful and dynamic visualization of the standout players. It's a fantastic tool for cricket enthusiasts and analysts looking to understand the game better and appreciate the performances that shaped the tournament.
